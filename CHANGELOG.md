# Future features to develop
- Player vs player fighting.
- Improve time to interactive by optimizing images format. See Chrome Audit.
- Fix the blinking of sprites and make their movement smoother.
- Fix some sprites that are not fighting, not dead but not moving either.
- Fix the label above each sprite rotating based on camera instead of facing straight to camera regardless of angle.
- Camera of player looking up and down in a way that feels natural would be a nice addon.
- Add reporting for test coverage.
- Write more tests.
- Document performance targets into PERFORMANCE.md
- Improve configuration of `forever` to fix 2 warnings: `--minUptime not set. Defaulting to: 1000ms` and `--spinSleepTime not set. Your script will exit if it does not stay up for at least 1000ms`
- Implement the module Ernesto is developing, to place particles around the environment without impacting server side socket communication load.
- Spawn npc in random positions near players instead of spawning anywhere in the large space. When npc die, also respawn them in random positions near players. Reduce the number of npc: instead of 99 npc, have just a few per player. This should improve performance overall.
- Monitor custom events (player starts, name, player disconnects) with Google Analytics.
- Persist data to a database, so that despite rebooting the game, the universe can be restored to a previous state and feel more persistent. Take frequent snapshots but not every single state change, overwise that will be too much data. There is no need to log old data, only keep the latest state.
- Login with Firebase.
- Store logs and usage in Firebase.
- Persist state of game in Firebase.
- Build a downloadable version of the game that can be run as a desktop app with [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) - see [sample project](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/electron-threejs-example)
- Publish the game on the Steam store.
- Publish also on the [Mac](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/mac-app-store-submission-guide) and [Windows](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/windows-store-guide) stores.
- Fix text labels that are black instead of white on Safari 12 (Mac desktop).
- Refactore code to use Javascript prototype on client-side.
